  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main class="diet-content">

    <!-- Phase 1: Menstrual -->
    <div class="diet-card">
      <h2>ðŸ©¸ Menstrual Phase</h2>
      <p>The menstrual phase begins when you have your period. During this time, your body sheds the uterine lining and experiences a drop in estrogen and progesterone levels. This can lead to fatigue, cramps, and iron depletion.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It's crucial to replenish lost iron to avoid fatigue and support overall well-being. Ignoring this phase's nutritional needs can lead to prolonged exhaustion, anemia, or more intense menstrual symptoms.</p>
      <p><strong>Consequences of neglect:</strong> Lack of proper nutrition during this phase can exacerbate cramps, fatigue, and even lead to hormonal imbalances that affect subsequent phases of your cycle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat: Iron-rich foods like spinach, lentils, red meat</li>
        <li>Drink: Warm water, ginger tea (helps cramps!)</li>
        <li>Avoid: Cold foods, excess salt (bloating)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 2: Follicular -->
    <div class="diet-card">
      <h2>ðŸŒ± Follicular Phase</h2>
      <p>The follicular phase begins right after menstruation and lasts until ovulation. During this time, your energy levels rise as estrogen levels increase, and your body starts preparing for ovulation. This is a great time to embrace light, fresh foods that support energy production.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your body is preparing for ovulation and needs nutrients that support this process. Not eating well during this phase can result in low energy, hormone imbalance, or even difficulty conceiving later on.</p>
      <p><strong>Consequences of neglect:</strong> Ignoring the needs of this phase can lead to sluggishness, weak immunity, and a slower metabolic rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat: Leafy greens, eggs, salmon, berries</li>
        <li>Hydrate: Coconut water, smoothies</li>
        <li>Avoid: Processed sugars (they mess with hormones)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 3: Ovulation -->
    <div class="diet-card">
      <h2>ðŸ’– Ovulation Phase</h2>
      <p>The ovulation phase occurs when the mature egg is released from the ovary. Estrogen is at its peak, and your body is at its most fertile. It's essential to nourish your body with healthy fats, antioxidants, and nutrients that support fertility and hormonal balance.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Supporting your body with good fats and antioxidants is key for optimal fertility. Failure to do so can lead to hormonal disruptions and decreased fertility.</p>
      <p><strong>Consequences of neglect:</strong> Not supporting your body during ovulation can lead to hormonal imbalances, making it harder to conceive. It can also affect your skin, causing breakouts or dullness.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat: Avocado, nuts, seeds, asparagus</li>
        <li>Boost: Zinc & Vitamin C (citrus, pumpkin seeds)</li>
        <li>Avoid: Heavy carbs if you feel bloated</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Phase 4: Luteal -->
    <div class="diet-card">
      <h2>ðŸŒ™ Luteal Phase</h2>
      <p>The luteal phase follows ovulation and lasts until the start of your period. During this time, progesterone levels rise to support a potential pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels drop, which can lead to PMS symptoms like mood swings, cravings, and bloating.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proper nutrition during this phase can alleviate PMS symptoms, regulate mood swings, and prevent excessive cravings. Without it, you may experience intense PMS, irritability, or even hormonal imbalances.</p>
      <p><strong>Consequences of neglect:</strong> Skipping nutrients during this phase can exacerbate PMS, trigger emotional instability, and make cravings harder to manage, which can affect overall health and comfort.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat: Complex carbs (quinoa, oats), dark chocolate, bananas</li>
        <li>Cravings? Go for: Dates, peanut butter, dark cocoa</li>
        <li>Avoid: Caffeine, fried food</li>
      </ul>
