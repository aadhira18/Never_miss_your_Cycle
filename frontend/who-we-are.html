    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>
      We are a passionate team of young creators, developers, designers, and women’s health advocates on a mission to change the way the world views menstruation. 
      At <strong>Never Miss Your Cycle</strong>, we believe that period health is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Our platform was born out of a shared desire to 
      support girls and women in understanding their bodies, embracing their cycles, and taking charge of their well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide every menstruator with a safe, reliable, and user-friendly digital space where they can track their periods, manage symptoms, 
      and access educational resources. We aim to break the stigma, spark conversations, and ensure that no one ever feels alone or ashamed because of their cycle. 
      Through technology and compassion, we strive to make every cycle a little easier.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a future where menstrual health is openly discussed, supported, and celebrated — where schools, families, and communities treat it as a normal part of life. 
      A future where access to period tracking, care, and education is available to all, regardless of age or background. 
      By combining innovation with empathy, we’re working towards a healthier, more inclusive world.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity and Empathy:</strong> We welcome every user with respect and care, creating a judgment-free space for all menstruators.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy and Respect:</strong> Your data belongs to you. We prioritize transparency and never compromise your trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Wellness and Knowledge Sharing:</strong> We believe education is power — and we’re here to share, support, and grow together.</li>
      <li><strong>Innovation with Purpose:</strong> Every feature we design is guided by real needs and real feedback from our users.</li>
    </ul>
