        <h2>Normalize</h2>
        <p>
          Periods are a natural part of life, yet society has taught us to hide them. Girls grow up feeling embarrassed or ashamed, simply because they bleed. We aim to change this. Our platform encourages open conversations, removes the stigma, and builds confidence. With your support, we can help millions of young girls realize that their bodies are not something to be ashamed of—but celebrated.

        <h2>Empower</h2>
        <p>
          Empowerment starts with awareness. We provide tools that help users understand their bodies and cycles, track symptoms, moods, and health changes. When girls and women know what’s happening inside them, they feel stronger, safer, and more in control. By supporting us, you're enabling digital empowerment that improves lives and promotes self-care in the most meaningful way.

      <div class="support-text">
        <h2>Educate</h2>
        <p>
          In many communities, girls miss school or drop out altogether due to lack of menstrual knowledge or access to resources. We're on a mission to change this through accessible education and awareness campaigns. With engaging, easy-to-understand content, we make sure every girl knows her cycle and feels confident navigating it. Your support helps us reach more girls and create a truly educated generation.
